    Sub-critical Approximant &  $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\left(t - \hp\right) + \left(t-\hp\right)^2\sum_{n=0}^Na_n t^n$ & 
        old\_approximant.py & The approximant divergers for near-critical velocities. \\ \hline
    Simple Additive Approximant & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = 2\arcsin\left(\tanh\left(\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right) + \sum_{n=0}^Na_n t^n$ & criticial\_additive.py &  It limits properly and there's some improvement, but it doesn't fix the divergence \\  \hline 
    Simple Multiplicative Approixmant & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \left[\varepsilon + \arcsin\left(\tanh\left(\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right)\right] \sum_{n=0}^Na_nt^n$  & critical\_multiplicative.py &  Convergence is just terrible. In fact, a bigger fudge factor $\varepsilon$ accelerates convergence. It's possible actually dividing might help, but I'm doubtful. \\ \hline 
    Original Guess & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi - 4\exp\left(-\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + \exp\left(-t\sqrt{2}\right)\sum_{n=0}^Na_nt^n$ & exp\_first\_order.py & The convergence here is notably improved, espcially near criticality for few terms,  but  tell it's actively diverging. \\ \hline 
    Sinh with Cosine & $ \displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\sqrt{2}\sinh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t - \frac{T}{2}\right)\right) + \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{T}t\right)^3 \sum_{k=1}^n a_n t^{n}$ & writeup\_sinh\_cos.py & It looks promising for a bit, but ultimately also diverges for the region we care about here of slight supercriticality.\\ \hline
    Sinh with Polynomial & $ \displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\sqrt{2}\sinh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t - \frac{T}{2}\right)\right) + \left(t - \hp\right)^3 \sum_{k=1}^n a_n t^{n}$ & writeup\_sinh\_poly.py & Looks almost certainly the best of all the approximants we've tried so far. For 5 terms it looks like it would be the right answer. But it only holds asymptotically, and starts to diverge.  \\ \hline
    Pure Sakiadis & $ \displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \exp\left(-\frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right) $ & pure\_sakiadis.py & It converges, for the first time. The only trouble seems to be that's it quite slow, especially near the end in the slightly supercritical case. It's also quite good in the large-velocity regime. It seems like this might be the idea. \\ \hline
    Open-constant Sakiadis & $ \displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \exp\left(-\frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right) $ & open\_sakiadis.py & This is also convergent and a significant improvement over the pure Sakiadis. But the curves could likely benefit from information at the other end.  \\ \hline
    First order Trig Sakiadis & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)\sum_{n=1}^N a_n \exp\left(-\frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$ & trig\_fo\_sak.py & This works quite well. By about 15 terms one nearly has visual indistinguishability. It could probably be beaten, though.  \\  \hline
    First order Polynomial Sakiadis & $ \displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \left(t - \hp\right)\sum_{n=1}^N a_n \exp\left(-\frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$ & poly\_fo\_sak.py & This behaves \textit{very} similarly to the trig approximant of the same order, but slightly worse. Probably converges asymptotically the same, with a slower constant, say.  \\ \hline 
    Third Order Trig Sakiadis & $\displaystyle \theta_{A,N}(t) = \pi - \frac{T}{\pi}\wt \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right) + \cos^3\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)\sum_{n=1}^N a_n \exp\left(-\frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$ & trig\_to\_sak.py & This is probably the best so far. In terms of overall convergence, this seems as good as anything so far. It may well be a functional solution. \\ \hline 
    Third Order Polynomial Sakiadis & $ \displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\left(t - \hp
    \right) + \left(t - \hp\right)^3\sum_{n=1}^N \exp\left(-\frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$  & poly\_to\_sak.py & This looks quite good. It's similar to, but better than The trigonometric version (unlike the first-order case, suprisingly). This would likely be a good-enough solution. \\ \hline
    Second Order Trig Sakiadis & $\displaystyle \theta_{A,N}(t) = \pi - \frac{T}{\pi}\wt \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)\sum_{n=1}^N a_n \exp\left(-\frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$ & trig\_so\_sak.py  & Shockingly, this does look to be better in the middle. I think the original motivation for this was a bug, too, but qualitatively at least this looks better in the middle. This might be to do with the fact the second derivative is 0? \\ \hline 
    Second Order Polynomial Sakiadis  & $ \displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\left(t - \hp
    \right) + \left(t - \hp\right)^2\sum_{n=1}^N \exp\left(-\frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$ & poly\_so\_sak.py &  This is at the stage where it's hard for me to visually distinguish in matplotlib. I'll get some quantitative metric eventually, but for now it seems like this is better than the above for small $N$, but eventually worse. \\ \hline
    Exponential First Order Multiplicative & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \left(\pi - 4\exp\left( -\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right) \sum_{n=0}^Na_nt^n$  & exp\_fo\_mult.py & This is terrible. It feels out of place with the stuff we've been trying, but it seemed like it might've been better than the pure multiple. It was not. \\ \hline
    Reciprocal Pure Sakiadis & $ \displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \frac{\displaystyle \vphantom{\sum}\pi}{\displaystyle 1 + \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \exp\left(- \frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & recip\_pure\_sak.py & IMPOSSIBLE. The value at $0$ cannot be the same without one of the approximant coefficients being infinite. Which we note because it forces us to take a stronger form.  \\ \hline
    Near Reciprocal Open-Coefficient Sakiadis & $ \displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi +  \frac{\displaystyle \vphantom{\sum} 1}{\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \exp\left(- \frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & near\_recip\_oc\_sak.py & It does converge, and it does as Nate guessed work much better at the low end. But the convergence at the top is really quite slow. A pinned version might be great though. \\ \hline
    Near-Reciprocal Pinned Open-Coefficient Polynomial Sakiadis  & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi +  \frac{\displaystyle \vphantom{\sum} t - \hp}{\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \exp\left(- \frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & nr\_oc\_fo\_poly\_sak.py & This looks very good. It's still hard to tell for sure with just the plots, but it's certainly a contender to be the best. \\ \hline
     Near-Reciprocal Pinned Open-Coefficient Trig Sakiadis  & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi +  \frac{\displaystyle \vphantom{\sum} \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)}{\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \exp\left(- \frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & nr\_oc\_fo\_trig\_sak.py & This looks slightly better than the above. Who can tell, but this is another contender.  \\ \hline
     Near-Reciprocal Second-Order Open-Coefficient Polynomial Sakiadis  & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\left(t-\hp\right) +  \frac{\displaystyle \vphantom{\int\limits_{}^{\sum}} \left(t-\hp\right)^2}{\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \exp\left(- \frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & nr\_oc\_so\_poly\_sak.py & Again, the convergence looks good. The plots become indistinguishable by order 10 or so, and the 5 term error is small. \\ \hline
     Near-Reciprocal Second-Order Open-Coefficient Trig Sakiadis  & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi - \frac{T}{\pi} \wt\cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right) +  \frac{\displaystyle \vphantom{\int\limits_{}^{\sum}} \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)}{\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \exp\left(- \frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & nr\_oc\_so\_trig\_sak.py & Finally a bad one. It's still not that distinguishable at 10 terms, but noticeably worse than the above.\\
     \hline
     Near-Reciprocal Third-Order Open-Coefficient Polynomial Sakiadis  & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\left(t-\hp\right) +  \frac{\displaystyle \vphantom{\int\limits_{}^{\sum}} \left(t-\hp\right)^3}{\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \exp\left(- \frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & nr\_oc\_to\_poly\_sak.py & This might be amazing convergence. I think it works \textit{quite} well. Yet another contender. \\ \hline
     Near-Reciprocal Second-Order Open-Coefficient Trig Sakiadis  & $\displaystyle \theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi - \frac{T}{\pi} \wt\cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right) +  \frac{\displaystyle \vphantom{\int\limits_{}^{\sum}} \cos^3\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)}{\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \exp\left(- \frac{nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & nr\_oc\_to\_trig\_sak.py & Another bad one. Noticably the higher order terms seem to contribute less here.  \\ \hline
      $\tanh$ First Order Multiplicative & $\displaystyle\theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi +  \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right)\sum_{n=0}^N a_n t^n$ & tanh\_fo\_mult.py & It helps a little, but doesn't actually handle the divegence. Still diverges.  \\ \hline
     $\tanh$ Open-coefficient First-Order Sakiadis & $\displaystyle\theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi +  \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right)\sum_{n=0}^Na_n\exp\left(\frac{-nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$ & tanh\_oc\_fo\_sak.py & This looks quite good. I would conjecture it is in fact better than the other First order Sakiadis ones. \\ \hline
     $\tanh$  Near-Reciprocal Open-coefficient First-Order Sakiadis & $\displaystyle\theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \frac{\displaystyle \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right)}{\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^Na_n\exp\left(\frac{-nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & tanh\_nr\_oc\_fo\_sak.py & The convergence on this one is much less good. It does converges. It doesn't near the top of the list. \\ \hline
     $\tanh$ Open-coefficient Second-Order Sakiadis & $\displaystyle\theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\sqrt{2} \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right)  + \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right)^2\sum_{n=0}^Na_n\exp\left(\frac{-nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$ & tanh\_oc\_so\_sak.py & This looks good. I would guess one of the tanh functions might also be in the running. \\ \hline
     $\tanh$  Near-Reciprocal Open-coefficient Second-Order Sakiadis & $\displaystyle\theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\sqrt{2} \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right) + \frac{\displaystyle \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right)^2}{\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^Na_n\exp\left(\frac{-nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & tanh\_nr\_oc\_so\_sak.py & This is relatively poor. The tanh doesn't seem to work well with the reciprocation. It is convergent, though. \\ \hline
     $\tanh$ Open-coefficient Third-Order Sakiadis & $\displaystyle\theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\sqrt{2} \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right)  + \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right)^3\sum_{n=0}^Na_n\exp\left(\frac{-nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$ & tanh\_oc\_to\_sak.py & As expected, this converges what seems to be quite well. It may also be among the best we've checked out.  \\ \hline
     $\tanh$  Near-Reciprocal Open-coefficient Third-Order Sakiadis & $\displaystyle\theta_{A, N}(t) = \pi + \wt\sqrt{2} \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right) + \frac{\displaystyle \tanh\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(t-\hp\right)\right)^3}{\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^Na_n\exp\left(\frac{-nt}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}$ & tanh\_nr\_oc\_to\_sak.py & This is also convergent, and probably the best of the tanh reciprocals we've tried, but it's still not that comepetitive.  \\ \hline
